I am a Research Fellow in quantum computing and quantum physics. My research revolves around quantum computing, quantum information, and quantum many-body physics. My research lies in the exploration of quantum computing as a means to address problems that present challenges for classical computing. I aim to uncover the potential power of quantum computing, and examine whether it holds advantages in tackling quantum many-body problems. 

Find some interesting research topics and descriptions of my selected research works under **Research**. 

A beginner's guide to quantum computing could be found in my thesis below.
