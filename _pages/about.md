I am a Research Fellow in quantum computing and quantum physics. I did postdoctoral research with Tom Gur at Cambridge, Myungshik Kim at Imperial, Andrew Green at University College, and came back to Oxford supported by a Fellowship. I did my PhD with Vlatko Vedral and Andrew Boothroyd, who navigated me to research quantum, and I am very fortunate to get entangled with my supervisors.


**Research interest**

Quantum computing, quantum information, and quantum many-body physics

My research revolves around quantum computing, quantum information, and quantum many-body physics. My research lies in the exploration of quantum computing as a means to address problems that present challenges for classical computing. My research aims to uncover the potential power of quantum computing, and examine whether it holds advantages in tackling quantum many-body problems.
