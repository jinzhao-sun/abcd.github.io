I have been working on quantum computing, quantum information, and quantum many-body physics.  I did postdoctoral research with Tom Gur at Cambridge, Myungshik Kim at Imperial, Andrew Green at University College, and came back to Oxford supported by a Schmidt AI in Science Fellowship. I am very fortunate to be supervised by Vlatko Vedral and Andrew Boothroyd and get entangled with them, who navigated my research in the quantum realm.
