I have been working on quantum computing, quantum information, and quantum many-body physics. Below let us explore  a few interesting topics.

** Quantum algorithms **

** Quantum many-body phenomena **

I have been interested in interesting many-body phenomena since my undergraduate study. I wonder if we could have a better understanding of emergent quantum phenomena in quantum materials.

I have worked on HTSC.


** Quantum error mitigation and its transitions to quantum error correction **

I have been wondering how to overcome the fundemental limits set up by QEM. This motivates us to think about an intermediate form between QEM and QEC.

** Quantum computational chemistry **

The application of quantum computing to computational chemistry faces various experimental and theoretical challenges. Here, we address the critical challenges associated with solving molecular electronic structures using noisy quantum processors. We demonstrated a quantum simulation that in theory goes beyond the mean-field level. We achieved chemical accuracy for small molecules.

The protocol presents significant improvements in the circuit depth and running time, key metrics for chemistry simulation. Through systematic hardware enhancements and the integration of error mitigation techniques, we push forward the limit of quantum computational chemistry and successfully scale up the implementation of VQE with an optimised unitary coupled-cluster ansatz. We produce high-precision results of the ground-state energy for molecules with error suppression by around two orders of magnitude.
