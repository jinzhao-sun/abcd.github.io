** Quantum computational chemistry **

The application of quantum computing to computational chemistry faces various experimental and theoretical challenges. Here, we address the critical challenges associated with solving molecular electronic structures using noisy quantum processors. The protocol presents significant improvements in the circuit depth and running time, key metrics for chemistry simulation. Through systematic hardware enhancements and the integration of error
mitigation techniques, we push forward the limit of quantum computational chemistry and successfully scale up the implementation of VQE with an optimised unitary coupled-cluster ansatz. We produce high-precision
results of the ground-state energy for molecules with error suppression by around two orders of magnitude.
